= Introduction

== Items that are at play

* A list of items
* A list of items with a header
* A list of items with a footer
* A list of items with a header and footer

== Wow ok, that was weird

. Where is this going?
. What are the items?
. Can we have a fake name?

== Ok never mind, let's code

[source, javascript, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
var s = 30;
function factorial(s) {
    var result = 1;
    for (var i = 2; i <= s; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

=== Crud! I forgot about levels, how does that look?

* There is one
* There are two
* Amazing, there are three
* Cuando tiene tres, puede ser cuatro
